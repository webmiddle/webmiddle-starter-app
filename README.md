## Installing for local development

```sh
chmod +x link.sh
./link.sh
yarn
```

## Adding Browser

The `Browser` component isn't included by default as it greatly increases the install time,
since it requires a compatible verison of Chromium that is downloaded during installation.

If you need it, type the following

```bash
yarn add webmiddle-component-browser
```
